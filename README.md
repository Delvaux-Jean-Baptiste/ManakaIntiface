You can use the SFMToyWebsocket by Henry1887. It is a BepInExPlugin. If doing so, select SFM Toys instead of Screen Capture. Unlike screen capture, this'll work even if the game is not on the correct screen or resolution.


HOW IT WORKS
-----------------------------

Only work in fullscreen
Every 250 mmilisecond a capture is made of the bottom left pixels of the screen. Based on their color, the sex toys will be triggered accordingly.
